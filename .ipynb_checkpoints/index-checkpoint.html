      <p>
        If speed is what you are after, you cant go any better than the Scorpyd Aculeus 460FPS.<br />
        At 460 fps, there's hardly any other crossbow on the entire planet that can stand a chance in a side by side
        speed comparison.<br />
        The draw weight for this model is 180lbs,<br />
        and you can tell right away that more seasoned hunters will find it a good option for their needs.
      </p>
      <p>Its aggressive looks are not there just for show.<br />
        They stay true to a real killer that will make even <br />
        the most experienced hunter feel like the bow he or she<br />
        uses does something to increase the results.<br />
        It is not particularly lightweight, at 7.5lbs, <br />
        but there are other crossbows on the market that are heavier <br />
        and don't offer the same high performance this particular model offers.
