          10 Fastest and Most Powerful Crossbows (sorted by FPS)

          <p>
            If speed is what you are after, you cant go any better
            than the Scorpyd Aculeus 460FPS.
            At 460 fps, there's hardly any other crossbow on the entire planet
            that can stand a chance in a side by side speed comparison.
            The draw weight for this model is 180lbs,
            and you can tell right away that more seasoned hunters will find
            it a good option for their needs.
          </p>
          <p>Its aggressive looks are not there just for show.
            They stay true to a real killer that will make even
            the most experienced hunter feel like the bow he or she
            uses does something to increase the results.
            It is not particularly lightweight, at 7.5lbs,
            but there are other crossbows on the market that are heavier
            and don't offer the same high performance this particular model offers.
