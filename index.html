          <p>
            If speed is what you are after, you cant go any better than the
            Scorpyd Aculeus 460FPS. At 460 fps, there's hardly any other
            crossbow on the entire planet that can stand a chance in a side by
            side speed comparison. The draw weight for this model is 180lbs,
            and you can tell right away that more seasoned hunters will find
            it a good option for their needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its aggressive looks are not there just for show. They stay true
            to a real killer that will make even the most experienced hunter
            feel like the bow he or she uses does something to increase the
            results. It is not particularly lightweight, at 7.5lbs, but there
            are other crossbows on the market that are heavier and don't offer
            the same high performance this particular model offers.

          </div>

          <p>From the first look, the TenPoint Nitro X will do a great job to impress you. Its narrow profile when
            cocked, standing at just 7 inches, will tell you a few things about what this crossbow can do, starting
            with the fact that it will allow you to sneak through thick brush and narrow paths when following your
            prey. This model comes equipped with a RangeMaster scope that serves for compensating speed, to ensure that
            your bolts are as precise, as they are quick.
          </p>
          <p>You will get more than just a crossbow when you pick this one. The manufacturer includes six EVO-X bolts
            so that you can start practicing your aim as soon as the package is delivered to your door. The high speed
            of this bow is what recommends it most and foremost, as 440 fps is a number that will surely make a
            long-lasting impression.</p>
          <p>Other features include the AcuDraw PRO cocking device, a quiver with instant detach, and a side mount for
            it. It must also be mentioned that this model comes with noise dampening capabilities, due to the built-in
            string stop system.

          </div>

          <p>There are many reasons to like the Ravin R20. First of all, its sleek profile will allow you to manage to
            stalk your prey even when you need to navigate more cramped areas. From axle to axle the total width of the
            bow when cocked is 6 inches, and 10.5 inches when un-cocked. That means that the crossbow is compact and
            you will not encounter troubles moving it around. Its weight is moderate, at 7.1lbs, although there are
            many other models heavier than this. </p>

          <p>Benefiting from the use of superior technologies, this crossbow will make an impact on anyone who tries it
            for the first time. By employing improvements on their HeliCoil technology, the engineers behind this
            crossbow managed to make it hit speeds of up to 430 fps. Also, capable of 164 ft-lbs of kinetic energy, the
            Ravin R20 is an amazing crossbow in its own right.</p>

          <p>The crossbow is sold as part of a package, and you will also receive six arrows, also made by Ravin. You
            will have the basic kit needed to go out hunting. Besides the crossbow and the bolts, you will also get a
            cocking mechanism, a safety feature to prevent dry shots, and a mounting bracket. You will hardly need
            anything more from this product. </p>

          </div>

          <p>Barnett is known for the crossbows it makes and the overall sound quality of the products on its offer to
            customers. The Barnett Predator deserves a unique place in the line-up supplied by this company, in the
            sense that it is faster and more powerful than others that carry the same family name. At 430 fps, it may
            not be the absolute fastest crossbow on the planet, but it sure does come close to that title. Also, the
            kinetic energy developed is 156 ft lbs, something that tells you just how powerful this model is.</p>

          <p>The nice thing is that you get more than just the crossbow for the price. The illuminated scope will give
            you the extra edge when you go hunting in less than ideal light conditions, and the cocking device will let
            you draw your crossbow without a glitch. The manufacturer also includes with the package two Headhunter
            arrows, and lube wax to keep your crossbow in good functioning shape at all times.</p>

          <p>It weighs 7.6lbs, and overall it is a compact model. The flight track is made from aluminum, and there are
            string dampeners in place, to ensure that your crossbow is notably silent. You will also love how accurate
            and smooth its operation is. Other extras include an anti-dry fire system and a safety feature to prevent
            early shots.</p>

          <p>Part of the Carbonlite series from Barnett advertised as the company's premium lineup, the Ghost 420 is
            the kind of crossbow that you won't be able to overlook. The maximum speed it can reach is 420fps, which is
            enough to bring down most game you can find in the woods or elsewhere. At a draw weight of 185 lbs, it is
            quite clear what kind of weapon you are dealing with. The wide range of accessories that come with this
            crossbow is what makes it stand out even more. </p>

          <p>For instance, the illuminated scope comes with variable magnification power, which means that you will be
            able to adapt when you are out in the woods hunting, depending on what conditions you need. The trigger
            system comes in rifle-style and will prevent dry fires to eliminate the number of failed shots, something
            that might be a little too familiar to those who are new to using a crossbow. </p>

          <p>You will get many other extras that will convince you that this model is a good option for bow hunting.
            For instance, the string dampeners will reduce the noise made by cocking the string and releasing your
            arrows, which allows you to stay undetected. There is a quiver included, too, that you can mount on the
            side, for easy access to your arrows when out in the woods. </p>

          <p>Speed is essential for any crossbow, and hunters everywhere know that. Even a small increase in speed
            matters when comparing different models, which is why the first thing we will say about the TenPoint
            Stealth NXT is that the arrows you'll shoot from it will travel at a whopping 410 fps speed. While you may
            feel a bit concerned that more speed might affect accuracy somehow, you should not worry. </p>

          <p>This crossbow is as precise as it is fast, and you'll know you can't go wrong if you pick it for your next
            hunting adventure. It comes equipped with a scope made from aluminum so that it doesnt burden the crossbow
            with unnecessary weight. Also, you will notice that there is a setting for compensating arrow drop which
            can prove handy when you are out in the field. </p>

          <p>The fact that you can calibrate this crossbow depending on preferences and other exterior conditions is an
            excellent advantage. You also get a quiver with three arrows that you will find handy for your expeditions.
            The quiver is easy to detach, so you might not keep it all the time, depending on what you prefer. The
            AcuDraw technology increases the overall accuracy and reduces draw weight, which means that you'll find it
            easy to use. </p>

          <p>If what you want to do is to stay silent and deadly, the Gladiator is surely the right choice for you. A
            sophisticated noise dampening system is in place, and that's just a part of what the manufacturer did to
            create a crossbow that will make the competition envious. There are two string stops, as well as two limb
            dampeners, plus two silencers, to ensure that when you draw your string, not even the animal with the most
            sensitive sense of hearing could detect you. </p>

          <p>As far as speed goes, this model can reach 405 fps, enough to deal with prey of different sizes. There are
            other aspects of the Gladiator that will convince you this is a good buy. The rail is made from machined
            aluminum for increased durability and also for keeping the total weight of the crossbow to a minimum. The
            quiver can be mounted on both sides, as it is versatile and caters to both left-handed and right-handed
            shooters. </p>

          <p>Let's not forget about the excellent extras this model comes along with. The crossbow comes accompanied by
            a 4x32mm scope, as well as a quiver with three arrows, a rope cocker, and a sling. As you can see, you have

          <p>The name of this model from Barnett will let you in from the start what prey you're most likely to take
            down, should you decide in its favor. You will remain concealed in the brush, due to the Tru Bark camo
            pattern used for this bow, provided that your clothes supply good camouflage, too. At 400 fps, this
            crossbow is fast enough to take down whitetail, and it will also impress you with its accuracy. Here are a
            few other details that will let you know whether this crossbow is for you or not. </p>

          <p>The draw weight of the bow is 165lbs, but there is a rope cocking device available with your purchase,
            which means that the necessary power to employ will be less than that. At a kinetic energy of 140 ft lbs,
            this crossbow is sure to make an impact. Seeing how its physical weight is 6.9lbs, this one is also lighter
            than others on the market. It is not particularly slim, but it will do its job, and you might just return
            home carrying a trophy. </p>

          <p>Other aspects we should mention are the step-through riser with a design patented by Barnett, and the
            string dampeners that will make sure that you are shooting your arrows silently, at high speeds, without
            your prey suspecting anything. As long as you’ll take good care of your crossbow, it will serve you with
            loyalty, and you will yield great results. </p>

              <li>Excellent extras, such as an illuminated scope, and string dampeners, are included with your purchase
              </li>
              <li>Its maximum speed of 400fps ensures that you will be able to drop whitetail like a seasoned hunter
              </li>
              <li>The manufacturer ships the crossbow almost completely assembled, so there is little you will have to

            <div class="unordered_list_child">
              <li>There are mentions from users about the difficulty of cocking the bow, especially for someone of a
                smaller stature

          </div>

          <p>The Barnett BC Revengeance weighs 8.4lbs, which may not make it a lightweight choice, but everything evens
            out, once you take a look at its speed and power. Your arrows will fly quite far, and the kinetic energy
            you'll develop is 135 ft lbs. Another aspect you may want to learn about this model is that it will make
            your arrows fly at 400 fps. </p>

          <p>We should talk a little about the unique Trigger Tech feature that prevents you from shooting dry fires
            and can correct the bad habit of shooting prematurely. Due to the zero-creep release, this system is
            particularly useful, and you will be more than pleased with its results. Made with stainless steel
            elements, this crossbow can take bad weather conditions without showing signs of corrosion and rust. </p>

          <p>You will appreciate the fact that the manufacturer ships it fully assembled. Another thing you will like
            about it is the plethora of accessories included in the package, such as an illuminated scope, a quiver
            with two arrows, and a rope cocking device. Pretty much anything you need to start hunting is included in
            your purchase. Also, the manufacturer put some lube wax in the package to ensure that you have what you
            need to maintain your crossbow in top notch condition. </p>
