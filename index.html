    <h3>
      <p>
        If speed is what you are after, you cant go any better than the Scorpyd Aculeus 460FPS.
        At 460 fps, there's hardly any other crossbow on the entire planet that can stand a chance in a side by side
        speed comparison.
        The draw weight for this model is 180lbs,
        and you can tell right away that more seasoned hunters will find it a good option for their needs.
      </p>
      <p>Its aggressive looks are not there just for show.
        They stay true to a real killer that will make even 
        the most experienced hunter feel like the bow he or she
        uses does something to increase the results.
        It is not particularly lightweight, at 7.5lbs, 
        but there are other crossbows on the market that are heavier 
        and don't offer the same high performance this particular model offers.
