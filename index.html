          <h3>1. Scorpyd Aculeus (460 fps)</h3>

          <div class="main_img">
            <img src="/html-rishabghosh/images/Scorpyd-Aculeus.jpg" alt="Scorpyd-Aculeus" />
          </div>

          <p>
            If speed is what you are after, you cant go any better than the
            Scorpyd Aculeus 460FPS. At 460 fps, there's hardly any other
            crossbow on the entire planet that can stand a chance in a side by
            side speed comparison. The draw weight for this model is 180lbs,
            and you can tell right away that more seasoned hunters will find
            it a good option for their needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its aggressive looks are not there just for show. They stay true
            to a real killer that will make even the most experienced hunter
            feel like the bow he or she uses does something to increase the
            results. It is not particularly lightweight, at 7.5lbs, but there
            are other crossbows on the market that are heavier and don't offer
            the same high performance this particular model offers.
          </p>

          <ul class="unorderd_list_parent"><b>Pros</b>

            <div class="unordered_list_child">
              <li>Its price tag cannot be ignored, and that's a reason to go for this model only if you are serious

          <h3>2. TenPoint Nitro X (440 fps)</h3>

          <div class="main_img">
            <img src="/html-rishabghosh/images/TenPoint-Nitro-X.jpg" alt="Scorpyd-Aculeus" />
          </div>

          <p>From the first look, the TenPoint Nitro X will do a great job to impress you. Its narrow profile when
            cocked, standing at just 7 inches, will tell you a few things about what this crossbow can do, starting
            with the fact that it will allow you to sneak through thick brush and narrow paths when following your
            prey. This model comes equipped with a RangeMaster scope that serves for compensating speed, to ensure that
            your bolts are as precise, as they are quick.
          </p>
          <p>You will get more than just a crossbow when you pick this one. The manufacturer includes six EVO-X bolts
            so that you can start practicing your aim as soon as the package is delivered to your door. The high speed
            of this bow is what recommends it most and foremost, as 440 fps is a number that will surely make a
            long-lasting impression.</p>
          <p>Other features include the AcuDraw PRO cocking device, a quiver with instant detach, and a side mount for
            it. It must also be mentioned that this model comes with noise dampening capabilities, due to the built-in
            string stop system.
          </p>

          <ul class="unorderd_list_parent"><b>Pros</b>

            <div class="unordered_list_child">

          </ul>

          <ul class="unorderd_list_parent"><b>Cons</b>

            <div class="unordered_list_child">
              <li>Seeing how expensive it is, the TenPoint Nitro X is not for the average hunter, so bear this in mind
                when you compare various models available on the market</li>

          <h3>3. Ravin R20 Crossbow Package (430 fps)</h3>

          <div class="main_img">
            <img src="/html-rishabghosh/images/Ravin-R20-Crossbow-Package.jpg" alt="Scorpyd-Aculeus" />
          </div>

          <p>There are many reasons to like the Ravin R20. First of all, its sleek profile will allow you to manage to
            stalk your prey even when you need to navigate more cramped areas. From axle to axle the total width of the
            bow when cocked is 6 inches, and 10.5 inches when un-cocked. That means that the crossbow is compact and
            you will not encounter troubles moving it around. Its weight is moderate, at 7.1lbs, although there are
            many other models heavier than this. </p>

          <p>Benefiting from the use of superior technologies, this crossbow will make an impact on anyone who tries it
            for the first time. By employing improvements on their HeliCoil technology, the engineers behind this
            crossbow managed to make it hit speeds of up to 430 fps. Also, capable of 164 ft-lbs of kinetic energy, the
            Ravin R20 is an amazing crossbow in its own right.</p>

          <p>The crossbow is sold as part of a package, and you will also receive six arrows, also made by Ravin. You
            will have the basic kit needed to go out hunting. Besides the crossbow and the bolts, you will also get a
            cocking mechanism, a safety feature to prevent dry shots, and a mounting bracket. You will hardly need
            anything more from this product. </p>

          <ul class="unorderd_list_parent"><b>Pros</b>

            <div class="unordered_list_child">
              <li>The package contains all that is needed for you to go hunting, even a cocking mechanism, and a pack
                of arrows for practice or taking down prey
              <li>At speeds of 440 fps, this crossbow is an excellent option for anyone who puts a value on velocity</li>
              <li>Its sleek profile will allow you to hunt down your prey in close quarters without having the
                equipment hinder your moves

              <li>For seasoned hunters, it may be a great choice, but for novices, it would be way too expensive, even

          <h3>4. Barnett Predator (430 fps) </h3>

            <img src="/html-rishabghosh/images/Barnett-Predator.jpg" alt="Barnett-Predator" />
          </div>

          <p>Barnett is known for the crossbows it makes and the overall sound quality of the products on its offer to
            customers. The Barnett Predator deserves a unique place in the line-up supplied by this company, in the
            sense that it is faster and more powerful than others that carry the same family name. At 430 fps, it may
            not be the absolute fastest crossbow on the planet, but it sure does come close to that title. Also, the
            kinetic energy developed is 156 ft lbs, something that tells you just how powerful this model is.</p>

          <p>The nice thing is that you get more than just the crossbow for the price. The illuminated scope will give
            you the extra edge when you go hunting in less than ideal light conditions, and the cocking device will let
            you draw your crossbow without a glitch. The manufacturer also includes with the package two Headhunter
            arrows, and lube wax to keep your crossbow in good functioning shape at all times.</p>

          <p>It weighs 7.6lbs, and overall it is a compact model. The flight track is made from aluminum, and there are
            string dampeners in place, to ensure that your crossbow is notably silent. You will also love how accurate
            and smooth its operation is. Other extras include an anti-dry fire system and a safety feature to prevent
            early shots.</p>

              <li>Some safety features are in place and make this model an excellent pick for a beginner </li>

            <div class="unordered_list_child">
              <li>Although novices will find it a great pick, let's not forget that the price is a bit too steep for
