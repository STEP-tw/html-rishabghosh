      <p>Being at this page can only mean one thing; you are out there looking for the <b>fastest
          crossbow</b>.
        Well, if you are just like me, I know how obsessed about shooting the most powerful crossbow available on
        the
        market can you be.
        You get thrilled with the idea of holding that great power in your hands.
      </p>
      <p>You want to rest assured that your bow won't let you down at the most critical moment
        and that it will take down even the largest game within seconds.
        Whether you are a recurve, a compound or a reverse draw crossbow fan, we
        have sorted the fastest rigs out for you.
        If there are other more powerful crossbows that we missed out there in
        the market feel free to drop us a message. <h3>Enjoy :-)</h3>

      <h2>
        10 Fastest and Most Powerful Crossbows (sorted by FPS)
      </h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3><u>Scorpyd Aculeus (460 fps)</u></h3>
        </li>
        <img src="html-rishabghosh/images/Scorpyd-Aculeus.jpg" alt="Scorpyd-Aculeus" />
        <p>
          If speed is what you are after, you cant go any better than the Scorpyd Aculeus 460FPS.
          At 460 fps, there's hardly any other crossbow on the entire planet that can stand a chance in a side by
          side
          speed comparison.
          The draw weight for this model is 180lbs,
          and you can tell right away that more seasoned hunters will find it a good option for their needs.
        </p>
        <p>Its aggressive looks are not there just for show.
          They stay true to a real killer that will make even
          the most experienced hunter feel like the bow he or she
          uses does something to increase the results.
          It is not particularly lightweight, at 7.5lbs,
          but there are other crossbows on the market that are heavier
          and don't offer the same high performance this particular model offers.
