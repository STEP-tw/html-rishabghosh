          <h2>10 Fastest and Most Powerful Crossbows (sorted by FPS)</h2>

          <h3>1.  Scorpyd Aculeus (460 fps)</h3>

          <img src="/html-rishabghosh/images/Scorpyd-Aculeus.jpg" alt="Scorpyd-Aculeus" />

          <p>
            If speed is what you are after, you cant go any better than the
            Scorpyd Aculeus 460FPS. At 460 fps, there's hardly any other
            crossbow on the entire planet that can stand a chance in a side by
            side speed comparison. The draw weight for this model is 180lbs,
            and you can tell right away that more seasoned hunters will find
            it a good option for their needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its aggressive looks are not there just for show. They stay true
            to a real killer that will make even the most experienced hunter
            feel like the bow he or she uses does something to increase the
            results. It is not particularly lightweight, at 7.5lbs, but there
            are other crossbows on the market that are heavier and don't offer
            the same high performance this particular model offers.
